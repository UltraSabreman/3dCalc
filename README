This is a fully featured (or at least will be lol) 3d graphing calculator in gmod.

Features:

1) Zoomability (broken atm while I re-write and mess with the scaling system for the axis)
2) Animations, you will be able to specify frames and interval to animate.
3) Different rendering/coloring modes
4) Won’t lock up your game when rendering


How to use:

Load Script (might have to reload do to messy inits)
Use “graph” command followed by an equation to make a plot (ie: “graph cos(x)”)
To Change zoom, open file and at the bottom edit the zoomin command.
To Change Material, open file and edit render mat at top.

Other than that everything else is hardcoded and unchangeable at the moment.
Feel free to mess with the code to get it do what you want, but don’t be
Surprised if it breaks.
