This is a fully featured (or at least will be lol) 3d graphing calculator in gmod.

Features:

1) Zoomability (broken atm while I re-write and mess with the scaling system for the axis)
2) Animations, you will be able to specify frames and interval to animate.
3) Different rendering/coloring modes
4) Wont lock up your game when rendering :p

How to use:
Atm all you can really do is use the concommand "graph" followed by an 
equation you want to graph (as I have yet to add more commands for zooming as such).

Example: graph cos(x) * sin(1/y)
